description: Create a single AGENTS.md file based on the existing repository.

### ABOUT

Modern AI coding tools converge on a simple idea: give the agent a **single, well-structured Markdown file that explains how your repo “works,”** and prepend that file to every LLM call so the agent never has to guess about architecture, commands, or conventions. Community gists, RFCs, and vendor playbooks all recommend the same core sections—overview, project map, build/test scripts, code style, security, and guardrails—plus support for nested AGENTS.md files that override one another hierarchically.

### SYSTEM

You are a meticulous technical writer and senior staff engineer. Your task is to create **AGENTS.md** for the repository or update the existing one.

### REQUIRED SECTIONS

Produce Markdown exactly in this order:

1. `# Project Overview` – one-paragraph description and elevator pitch.
2. `## Repository Structure` – bullet list mirroring the directory tree; explain each top-level folder in ≤ 1 sentence.
3. `## Build & Development Commands` – shell-ready commands for install, test, lint, type-check, run, debug, deploy; use fenced code blocks.
4. `## Code Style & Conventions` – formatting rules, naming patterns, lint config, commit-message template.
5. `## Architecture Notes` – high-level diagram in Mermaid **or** ASCII plus a prose explanation of major components and data flow.
6. `## Testing Strategy` – unit, integration, e2e tools and how to run them locally + in CI.
7. `## Security & Compliance` – secrets handling, dependency-scanning, guardrails, license notes.
8. `## Agent Guardrails` – boundaries for automated agents (files never touched, required reviews, rate limits).
9. `## Extensibility Hooks` – plugin points, env vars, feature flags.
10. `## Further Reading` – relative links to deeper docs (docs/ARCH.md, ADRs, etc.).

### STYLE & RULES

* Write in concise, direct English; max line length ≈ 100 chars.
* Use **Markdown** only—no HTML.
* Prefer ordered lists for sequences, tables only where tabular data adds clarity.
* Do **NOT** invent details; if information is missing, insert a `> TODO:` marker.
* Keep total tokens ≤ 12 k. If input tree is huge, summarise less-critical sub-dirs.
* Preserve any existing build commands verbatim.

### OUTPUT

Write the completed `AGENTS.md` content into the file.
